      <h1>How has space impacted your life?</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center">
        We often take space exploration for granted and assume it has no value
        when compared to other things on this planet. The majority of people
        typically are not exposed to astronomy very much, so they have no idea
        how much it actually affects their daily lives. You may not know either,
        here are some inventions used for space exploration that we use every
        day.

      <h2>1950's - Firefighting Equipment</h2>
      <img

        src="/Assets/Graphics/FirefighterGraphic.png"
        alt="Graphic of a firefighter putting out a fire with a fire extinguisher"
      />
      <p>
        To survive the harsh conditions of space, astronauts needed fire
        resistant clothing and space suits as well a cooling system to keep them
        warm in the cold temperatures of space. This helped develop fire
        resistant clothing for firefighters and cooling system which prevent
        firefighters from collapsing into the fire due to the heat. The same
        with breathing systems that prevent firefighters from breathing
        unhealthy air.

      <h2>Early 1960's - Bluetooth</h2>
      <img

        alt="The Bluetooth logo with transparent background"
        class="icon"
      />
      <p>
        NASA partnered with a company called Pacific Plantronics to create the
        Plantronics Model MS50 Headset to create one of the first lightweight
        wireless headsets. This was used during the Apollo and Atlas Programs,
        so astronauts could better communicate with mission control. The use of
        wireless headsets set the path towards the development of bluetooth
        devices, one of the most widely used inventions.

      <h2>1960's - Shock Absorbers</h2>
      <img
        class="icon"
        src="/Assets/Graphics/BuildingsGraphic.png"
        alt="Graphic of multiple buildings"
      />
      <p>
        Shock Absorbers were used to protect the space shuttle during launch.
        Today, they are used to protect buildings from Earthquakes.

      <h2>1960's - Water Filtering Systems</h2>
      <img
        class="icon"
        src="/Assets/Graphics/WaterGraphic.png"
        alt="Graphic of water."
      />
      <p>
        Water filtering systems were used during NASA's space missions to allow
        the astronauts to drink clean water. Their methods of water filtering
        has been standardized today.

      <h2>1960's - Highway Grooves</h2>
      <img

        alt="Graphic of a highway going straight with linear perspective used to give the illusion of depth."
      />
      <p>
        As a space shuttle returns, it had to land going very high speeds which
        means that a wet runway would increase the risk of the shuttle going out
        of control. The solution was grooves which redirected water away from
        the runway. Today, this same kind of technology is used to alert drivers
        that hey are leaving their lane.

      <h2>1971 - CAT Scans</h2>

        src="/Assets/Graphics/CATScanGraphic.png"
        alt="Graphic of a CAT stan."
      />
      <p>
        To recreate lunar pictures during the Apollo Program, NASA developed
        technology that are used for CAT and MRI scans today. They allow us to
        look inside the body without the need for surgery.

        src="/Assets/Graphics/HandheldVacuumGraphic.png"
        alt="Graphic of a handheld vacuum"
      />
      <p>
        NASA collaborated with Black & Decker to create a cordless handheld
        vacuum used to extract lunar samples during the Apollo Program which
        helped develop the handheld vacuums used in some households today.

      <h2>1981 - Artificial Arms</h2>
      <img

        src="/Assets/Graphics/ProsteticGraphic.png"
        alt="Graphic of a prosthetic arm"
      />
      <p>
        During the Space Shuttle Program, NASA frequently used robotic arms that
        could perform tasks such as repairs or inspections without the need for
        an astronaut present. This technology has helped up build prosthetic
        limbs which today are used to help motor functions and improve the
        quality of life for people who have lost a limb.

      <h2>1983 - Scratch Resistant Lenses</h2>

        src="/Assets/Graphics/AstronautHelmetGraphic.png"
        alt="Graphic of an astronaut helmet."
      />
      <p>
        NASA made scratch resistant helmets for astronauts in order to endure
        the harshness of space to protect the astronauts. Foster Grant, a
        producer of sunglasses, used this technology in 1983 to make glasses
        that were scratch resistant.

      <h2>1986 - Invisible Braces</h2>

        src="/Assets/Graphics/BracesGraphic.png"
        alt="Graphic of braces and mouth."
      />
      <p>
        The need for heat seeking missile systems called for the development of
        a transparent material called Translucent Polycrystalline Alumina (TPA).
        This material was great for protecting antennas that were used to track
        missiles. Today, this material is used for clear orthodontic braces.

      <h2>1986 - Insulin Pump</h2>
      <img
        class="icon"
        src="/Assets/Graphics/InsulinPumpGraphic.png"
        alt="Graphic of a bottle that says Insulin"
      />
      <p>
        NASA needed technology that would keep track of the astronaut's vitals
        during space missions. So they created the first insulin pumps that were
        used to monitor blood sugar and pump insulin. This was a breakthrough in
        the medical industry and is used today to treat people who have
        diabetes. This has made it easier for those people to treat diabetes and
        live a better quality life.

        src="/Assets/Graphics/Cameras.png"
        alt="Graphic of a camera."
      />
      <p>
        NASA developed a type of camera to take detailed pictures of space and
        other celestial objects. This has contributed to the cameras that you
        see in your cell phone and computer.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center">
        Space exploration isn't just something we do for fun, it's significantly
        helped develop the technologies that are used every single day. Some
        people may think NASA should be defunded, but those same people are
        using every day items that were made possible because we needed
        alternatives to work in space. NASA has shaped the way millions of
        people live, hopefully now you can see the importance of NASA.
