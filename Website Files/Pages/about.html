      <h3>About Me!</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, and thank you for visiting, I've made this website to share everything I have done and are working on. I'm a student who's been into astronomy since my 2nd grade year currently wanting to get into Aerospace Engineering for NASA or SpaceX. My favorite subjects are math, astronomy, science, and computer science.

      <h3>Freelance Services</h3>
      <p>
        On Fiverr, I offer web development services for those who want a website, but don't want to take the time to learn how or make a website. Having a coded website is significantly more beneficial than a drag and drop web builder.

        Explorer is my first app published to Google Play, I plan on making more

        the latest spaceflight information all in one place. Right now, I only
        publish to Google Play, but will expand into apple in the future.

        I'm pretty new to game development and have a game idea, but haven't
        really published anything yet. If you go to Unity Play or Itch.io,
        that's where you'll find the games I make that I don't plan on getting
        to a game store. Every game that I make will be published there for you
        to play.

      <h3>Programming Experience Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        Around August of 2024, I've started to get interested in making a website to share launch schedule information, didn't have any programming knowledge, so went with a site builder called Google Sites. Wanting more freedom, I taught myself web development September 2024 and published my first website the same month.
      </p>
      <p>The beginning of December 2024, I started teaching myself how to make and publish mobile apps with the Flutter framework eventually distributing my first mobile app to Google Play sometime in March 2025.</p>
      <p>Starting January 2025, I've started to briefly teach myself game development, but only really been dedicating the time since September of the same year. My first game will be published to the web in the beginning of January.</p>
